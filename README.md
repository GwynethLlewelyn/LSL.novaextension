# Linden Scripting Language (LSL) Nova extension

A Nova extension providing syntax highlighting for Linden Scripting Language (LSL), the scripting language used in the Second Life® and OpenSimulator virtual world platforms.

## Language Support

This extension currently supports the following features of Linden Scripting Language:

- Syntax Highlighting for the latest version of LSL (as of the time of releasing this extension)
- Auto-completions for major LSL constructions and functions (as far as I could make them work)
- OpenSimulator LSL functions

Note that LSL is a language in perpetual flux, with Linden Lab constantly adding new features and functionality, and
sometimes making older versions obsolete, shuffling parameters around, etc. so at some point in time this extension will
be inevitably out of sync.
